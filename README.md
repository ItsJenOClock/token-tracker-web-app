# Token Tracker
In Magic: The Gathering (MTG), `tokens` are "virtual" cards that are not a part of a player's library (deck) that are created by effects of other cards. Tokens are a crucial aspect of gameplay, but managing them can be cumbersome. In Limited games, players may not have access to the corresponding token cards, while in constructed formats, players must bring their own tokens. Players currently rely on manual methods for token management, such as using dice, temporary dry-erase cards, other objects to represent tokens, or official token cards.

These manual methods can add to the complexity, expense, room for error, and clutter of an already intricate game, making it difficult for players to focus on strategy, gameplay, and fun.

**Token Tracker** is a web app that streamlines token management to enhance MTG gameplay and allows players to be more efficient and organized to play the game with tokens.
